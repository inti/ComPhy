# ComPhy
This package implements routines for Comparative Phylostratigraphy, i.e., to obtained and compare phylostratigraphic profiles. It allows to calculate the profiles as orifinally described by Domazet-Loso et. al. (2003) and also provides interesting extentions that are under development.

# Requirments
Several Python packages are needed:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- ETE2
- progressbar
- pycogent
- biopython
- ipython = option but highly recommended for interactive analyses. 

An easy way to get the dependecies in place is using the Anaconda Python distribution. 

# Installation 

TODO: provide basic commands to set up a anaconda enviroment for the analyses

# Getting Started
	
Check the `example/apis_mell_test.py` file for a short example on how to perform the analyses. 

TODO: provide some basic examples of how to perform the analyses. Add an ipython-notebook
